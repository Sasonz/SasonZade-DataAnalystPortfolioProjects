Explanation:\n","# This command installs the `pandasql` library, which is useful for running SQL queries on pandas DataFrames.\n","# Although we are not using it in this script, it's useful when you want to run SQL queries directly on a pandas DataFrame.\n","\n","# Step 2: Mount Google Drive\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","# Explanation:\n","# This command mounts your Google Drive on the Colab instance. Once mounted, you'll be able to access files stored in your Google Drive.\n","# This step is essential to access and read the CSV file that contains the layoffs data.\n","# The CSV file path is specified later in the script for reading into a DataFrame.\n","\n","# Step 3: Load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","file_path = '/content/drive/My Drive/Data_Analyst/Portfolio_Projects/Projects/SQL/Layoffs_Dataset_for_Data_Cleaning.csv'\n","df = pd.read_csv(file_path)\n","# Explanation:\n","# This step loads the layoffs dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.\n","# The file path provided is the location of the CSV file in Google Drive.\n","# `pd.read_csv(file_path)` reads the CSV file and loads it into a DataFrame, which is an in-memory table-like data structure.\n","# This DataFrame (`df`) will be used for various operations like creating a database table, cleaning data, and running SQL queries.\n","\n","# Ensure Pandas displays a maximum of 500 rows\n","pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 500)\n","pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\n","# Explanation:\n","# These options configure how many rows and columns Pandas will display when you print a DataFrame.\n","# `display.max_rows` controls the maximum number of rows to display (500 in this case), which helps in displaying large datasets.\n","# `display.max_columns` controls how many columns to show (None means all columns are displayed).\n","\n","# Step 4: Using SQLite for SQL Queries\n","import sqlite3\n","\n","# Create an SQLite in-memory database and load the DataFrame into a table\n","conn = sqlite3.connect(\":memory:\")\n","df.to_sql(\"layoffs\", conn, index=False, if_exists=\"replace\")\n","# Explanation:\n","# `sqlite3.connect(\":memory:\")` creates an in-memory SQLite database. This is useful because the database is temporary and lives only during the current session.\n","# The `df.to_sql(\"layoffs\", conn, index=False, if_exists=\"replace\")` statement takes the DataFrame `df` and stores it into an SQLite table named \"layoffs\".\n","# `index=False` prevents the DataFrame index from being stored in the database.\n","# `if_exists=\"replace\"` replaces the table if it already exists in the SQLite database.\n","\n","# Step 5: Create layoffs_staging table with the same structure as layoffs\n","query_create_table = \"\"\"\n","CREATE TABLE layoffs_staging AS\n","SELECT * FROM layoffs WHERE 1=0;\n","\"\"\"\n","conn.execute(query_create_table)\n","# Explanation:\n","# This query creates a new table `layoffs_staging` with the same structure (column names and data types) as the `layoffs` table.\n","# The `WHERE 1=0` condition ensures that no data is inserted into the new table, only the schema is copied.\n","# This is useful to create a \"staging\" table that we can use for temporary transformations.\n","\n","# Step 6: Insert data from layoffs into layoffs_staging\n","query_insert = \"\"\"\n","INSERT INTO layoffs_staging\n","SELECT * FROM layoffs;\n","\"\"\"\n","conn.execute(query_insert)\n","# Explanation:\n","# This query inserts all records from the `layoffs` table into the newly created `layoffs_staging` table.\n","# The data is now stored in `layoffs_staging`, where we can apply any transformations without affecting the original data.\n","\n","# Step 7: Add row_num column to layoffs_staging\n","query_alter_table = \"ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging ADD COLUMN row_num INT;\"\n","conn.execute(query_alter_table)\n","# Explanation:\n","# This command adds a new column `row_num` to the `layoffs_staging` table.\n","# The `row_num` will be used later for tracking duplicate records or for other row-based operations.\n","# SQLite does not support direct `ALTER TABLE` to add a column with constraints or indexes.\n","# This is a simple column addition.\n","\n","# Step 8: Create layoffs_staging2 with row_num\n","query_create_table2 = \"\"\"\n","CREATE TABLE layoffs_staging2 (\n","    company TEXT,\n","    location
